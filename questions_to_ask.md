The key is to build mental models of a system at different levels of abstraction, from high-level architecture down to specific implementation details.

# Architecture & Design Questions
- What is the overall purpose and scope of this system? (Understanding the "why" before the "how")
- What are the main components and how do they interact? (Getting the big picture)
- What design patterns are being used and why were they chosen? (Understanding architectural decisions)
- How does data flow through the system? (Following the request/response lifecycle)
- What are the system's boundaries and interfaces? (Understanding what's inside vs. outside)
- How does this system handle errors and edge cases? (Understanding robustness and failure modes)
- What are the performance characteristics and bottlenecks? (Understanding scalability concerns)

# Technical Implementation Questions
- What language/framework versions are being used and why? (Understanding technology choices)
- How is the build system configured and what does it do? (Understanding the development workflow)
- What dependencies are included and what do they provide? (Understanding external libraries)
- How is configuration managed across different environments? (Understanding deployment concerns)
- What testing strategies are in place? (Understanding quality assurance)
- How is logging and monitoring implemented? (Understanding observability)
- What security measures are in place? (Understanding protection mechanisms)

# Learning & Documentation Questions
- Where is the best documentation for this system? (Finding learning resources)
- Are there code examples or tutorials I can follow? (Getting hands-on experience)
- What are the coding standards and conventions? (Understanding style guidelines)
- How do I set up my development environment? (Getting started quickly)
- What debugging tools and techniques are available? (Understanding troubleshooting)
- Are there any common pitfalls I should avoid? (Learning from others' mistakes)

# Development & Deployment Questions
- How do I run the system locally for development? (Getting hands-on experience)
- What's the deployment process and how do I deploy changes? (Understanding the release cycle)
- How do I add new features or modify existing ones? (Understanding extensibility)
- What's the branching strategy and how do I contribute code? (Understanding collaboration)
- How are database changes and migrations handled? (Understanding data management)

# What They Often Miss (Critical Questions)
- What happens when things go wrong? (Understanding failure scenarios and recovery)
- How does this system integrate with other systems? (Understanding the broader ecosystem)
- What are the performance requirements and how are they measured? (Understanding expectations)
- How do you handle backward compatibility when making changes? (Understanding maintenance)
- What monitoring and alerting is in place? (Understanding operational concerns)
- How do you handle secrets and sensitive configuration? (Understanding security practices)
- What's the backup and disaster recovery strategy? (Understanding business continuity)
- How do you handle different environments (dev, staging, prod)? (Understanding deployment complexity)
- What's the change management and approval process? (Understanding governance)
- How do you handle third-party service dependencies? (Understanding external risks)

# Pro Tips for Students/Interns
- Start with the "why" before diving into the "how"
- Ask for diagrams or visual representations - they often reveal relationships you might miss
- Request a "walkthrough" of a typical user journey or request flow
- Ask about the history - understanding why certain decisions were made can reveal important context
- Request access to logs and monitoring - seeing the system in action is often more revealing than reading code
- Ask about the "pain points" - what frustrates experienced developers often reveals system complexity
- Request a "debugging session" - watching someone troubleshoot can teach you more than hours of reading
